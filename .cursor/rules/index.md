## Rule Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Rule

#### For New Feature Development
1. Start with **Full-Stack Features** rule for complete implementation pattern
2. Reference **Development** rule for workflow and best practices
3. Use **Migrations** rule for database changes
4. Follow **Testing** rule for comprehensive testing

#### For Bug Fixes
1. Use **Bugfixes** rule for systematic approach
2. Reference **Testing** rule for verification
3. Follow **Git** rule for version control

#### For Deployment
1. Use **Docker** rule for container management
2. Follow **Deployment** rule for production deployment
3. Reference **CI/CD** rule for automated processes

#### For Database Changes
1. Use **Migrations** rule for database schema changes
2. Reference **Development** rule for database best practices
3. Follow **Testing** rule for data integrity verification

### Rule Integration

#### Cross-Reference Patterns
- **Full-Stack Features** references **Migrations** for database changes
- **Development** references **Docker** for container management
- **Testing** references **Security** for security testing
- **Deployment** references **CI/CD** for automated deployment

#### Workflow Integration
1. **Planning**: Use Architecture and Development rules
2. **Implementation**: Use Full-Stack Features and Development rules
3. **Testing**: Use Testing and Security rules
4. **Deployment**: Use Docker, Deployment, and CI/CD rules
5. **Maintenance**: Use Bugfixes and Git rules

## Rule Maintenance

### Updating Rules
- Update rules when new patterns are discovered
- Validate rule recommendations through testing
- Document rule changes in CHANGELOG
- Share rule updates with the team

### Rule Validation
- Test rule recommendations in development environment
- Verify rule consistency across different contexts
- Ensure rules work with current toolchain
- Validate rule effectiveness through user feedback

## Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```bash
# Start development environment
cd docker && docker-compose up --build

# Run migrations
docker exec -it api npm run migration:run

# Access database
docker exec -it postgres psql -U platform_user -d platform_db

# View logs
docker-compose logs [service]

# Rebuild service
docker-compose up --build [service]
```

### File Locations
- **API**: `api/src/` - Backend TypeScript code
- **Frontend**: `webapp/src/` - React TypeScript code
- **Docker**: `docker/` - Container configuration
- **Deployment**: `deploy/` - Production deployment files

### Key Services
- **API**: http://localhost:4000 - Backend API
- **Webapp**: http://localhost:3000 - React frontend
- **Database**: localhost:5433 - PostgreSQL
- **Redis**: localhost:6379 - Cache and message queue
