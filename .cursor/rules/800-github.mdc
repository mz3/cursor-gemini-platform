# GitHub CLI Usage Patterns

- Always use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for interacting with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and workflows.
- To authenticate, run:
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```
- To create a new pull request from your current branch:
  ```bash
  gh pr create --fill
  ```
- To check out a pull request locally:
  ```bash
  gh pr checkout <pr-number>
  ```
- To view the status of GitHub Actions workflows for the current branch:
  ```bash
  gh run list
  ```
- To watch a workflow run in real time (preferred for monitoring CI):
  ```bash
  gh run watch <run-id>
  ```
- To fetch logs for a specific workflow run:
  ```bash
  gh run view <run-id> --log
  ```
- To leave feedback or comments on a pull request:
  ```bash
  gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "Your feedback here"
  ```
- Always check the status of your PRs and CI runs before merging.
- Use `gh pr merge <pr-number>` to merge pull requests, and prefer the "squash and merge" strategy unless otherwise specified.
