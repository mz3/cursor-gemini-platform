# feature development

- start with requirements and planning
- implement db layer first, then api, then frontend
- write unit, integration, and e2e tests
- use docker compose for local dev
- check container logs to verify ui and api restart when code is modified
- check container logs to verify apps started correctly when starting them up
- push to feature branch, monitor CI
- merge only after all tests pass
